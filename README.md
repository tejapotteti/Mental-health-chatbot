## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash

##  Example Questions to Try

Here are some example phrases you can type:

- **hi**
- **I feel sad**
- **I have fever**
- **I am stressed**
- **I can’t sleep**
- **I feel lonely**
- **I need motivation**
- **I have headache**
- **what is depression**
- **how to boost immunity**

---

##  How It Works

- The chatbot loads a **CSV file of pre-defined question-response pairs**.
- User messages are preprocessed with **NLTK** (tokenization, stop words removal, lemmatization).
- The chatbot uses **cosine similarity** to find the best match response.
- If no match is found, it shows a fallback message.
- A friendly **HTML/CSS frontend** is used for interaction.
